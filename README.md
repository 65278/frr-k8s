# frr-k8s

A kubernetes based daemnoset that exposes a subset of the FRR API in a kubernetes compliance manner.

## Description

This is a kubernetes-native FRR wrapper to be consumed as a standalone component or together with MetalLB.

The project is work in progress and once mature it will replace the embedded FRR container running in MetalLB.
